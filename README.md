# Swef - Smart Kitchen Assistant üç≥

Welcome to **Swef**, your AI-powered smart kitchen assistant! Swef helps you decide what to cook based on the ingredients you have in your fridge. It considers your budget and suggests recipes accordingly. If you're missing any ingredients, it will list them for easy purchase. Say goodbye to decision fatigue and hello to seamless meal planning!

## Project Overview

- **Backend**: Built with Flask, this is where the magic happens! The backend handles requests, fetches fridge items, and interacts with the AI/ML API for recipe suggestions.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is pretty basic without design, serving as a simple interface to display fridge items and allow users to select their budget.

## Features
